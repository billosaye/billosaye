👨‍🏭 Leading and collaborating with teams, I emphasize coding standards and best practices. My extensive background in app development ensures I'm always at the forefront of innovative full-stack engineering.

🛠️ My tech toolkit includes PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js, Next.js, EJS, Bootstrap, and WordPress. I thrive in Agile environments, crafting accessible UIs for web applications and emphasizing continuous integration and quality.
